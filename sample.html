  <h1>About JUPEB</h1>

  <p>JUPEB is an acronym for Joint University Preliminary Examination Board, an established Advanced Level examination body coordinated by the University of Lagos. It serves as a pathway for candidates unable to secure admission to regular degree programs in Nigerian universities, requiring only O'Level results for enrollment, including candidates awaiting their results.</p>

  <p>Recognized and approved by the Federal Government, JUPEB facilitates admissions into higher institutions in Nigeria and abroad. Annually, around 20,000 applicants apply, with over 70% successfully securing admission into 200 level in their preferred institutions and courses of study.</p>

  <p>The JUPEB program typically commences in August/September yearly, spanning 10 months and concluding in June/July of the following year. Resumption dates vary among institutions offering the program. Candidates interested in staying in school hostels are advised to apply early. Specific dates for each institution can be obtained by contacting them directly.</p>

  <p>The registration process for JUPEB is straightforward, and there are two ways to apply for admission. The application fee for the JUPEB program is #17,000, while the tuition fees range from #200,000 to #700,000, varying across different centers. Prospective candidates should check online for the specific fees at their chosen institution.</p>

  <p>Key benefits of undertaking the JUPEB program include exemption from the UTME (JAMB), uncertain validity period of results, direct entry admission to 200 level, and less susceptibility to disruptions due to university strikes or vacations. Payment of tuition fees in installments, generally up to twice, is allowed. Additionally, successful JUPEB candidates have the freedom to gain admission to other universities through direct entry.</p>

  <p>The admission requirements include a minimum of five credits, including English Language, Mathematics, and three other relevant subjects to the intended course of study. These credits must be obtained in a single sitting in SSCE/WASSCE, GCE/OL, or NECO exams before registration. Candidates must also be at least 16 years old by the 15th of October in the admission year succeeding the completion of the JUPEB program to be eligible for direct entry into Nigerian universities.</p>

  <p><strong>Please note:</strong> Contact details and specific addresses for JUPEB centers are available online or can be obtained by reaching out to the respective institutions directly.</p>
