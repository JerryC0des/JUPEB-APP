      <h2 class="h2">Physics Laws and Principles</h2>

      <h4>Laws of Motion:</h4>
      <ol>
        <li>Newton's First Law (Law of Inertia): states that an object remains at rest or in uniform motion in a straight line unless acted upon by an external force. This principle is commonly known as the law of inertia, signifying an object's reluctance to change its state of rest or uniform motion.</li>
        <li>Newton's Second Law of Motion: The rate of change of momentum of a body is proportional to the net external force acting upon the body.</li>
        <li>Newton's Third Law of Motion: To every force applied by a body A on body B, there is an equal and opposite force applied by body B on body A.</li>
      </ol>

      <h4>Laws of Gravitation and Planetary Motion:</h4>
      <ol>
        <li>Newton's Law of Universal Gravitation: The force of attraction between two particles on Earth's surfaces is directly proportional to the product of their masses and inversely proportional to the square of the separation distance.</li>
        <li>Kepler's Laws of Planetary Bodies:
          <ul>
            <li>First Law: All planets move about the sun in elliptical orbits, having the sun as one of the foci.</li>
            <li>Second Law: A radius vector from any planet to the sun sweeps out equal areas in equal lengths of time.</li>
            <li>Third Law: The squares of the sidereal periods of the planets are directly proportional to the cube of their mean distances from the sun.</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
      </ol>


      <h4>Principles in Fluid Mechanics:</h4>
      <ol>
        <li>
          <strong>Archimedes' Principle:</strong> When a body is partially or fully immersed in a fluid, it experiences an upward force (buoyant force) equal to the weight of the fluid displaced.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Pascal's Principle:</strong> Pressure applied to a confined liquid is transmitted undiminished in all directions.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Newton's Law of Viscosity:</strong> Shear stress between adjacent fluid layers is directly proportional to the velocity gradients between them.
        </li>
      </ol>

      <h4>Electromagnetism Laws:</h4>
      <ol>
        <li>
          <strong>Hooke's Law:</strong> The force required to compress or extend an object is directly proportional to the displacement, provided it stays within the elastic limit.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Coulomb's Law:</strong> The force of attraction or repulsion between two point charges is directly proportional to the product of their charges and inversely proportional to the square of the distance between them.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Gauss' Law:</strong> The net electric flux through a closed surface is proportional to the total enclosed electric charge.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Ampere's Circuital Law:</strong> The integral of the magnetic field along a closed path equals the product of the current enclosed by the path and the permeability of the medium.
        </li>
      </ol>

      <h4>Quantum Mechanics and Thermodynamics</h4>

      <h4>Principles in Quantum Mechanics:</h4>
      <ol>
        <li>
          <strong>de Broglie's Hypothesis:</strong> All matter exhibits both particle and wave properties.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Heisenberg's Uncertainty Principle:</strong> It's impossible to precisely determine both the position and momentum of a particle simultaneously.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Bragg's Law:</strong> X-rays incident on a crystal surface reflect back at the same angle.
        </li>
      </ol>

      <h4>Laws of Thermodynamics</h4>

      <ol>
        <li>
          <strong>Zeroth Law of Thermodynamics:</strong> The Zeroth Law states that if two systems are in thermal equilibrium with a third system, they are in thermal equilibrium with each other. It establishes the concept of temperature and allows the definition of a temperature scale.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>First Law of Thermodynamics:</strong> The change in the internal energy of a closed system equals the heat supplied minus the work done by the system on its surroundings.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Second Law of Thermodynamics:</strong> The Second Law introduces the concept of entropy, stating that the entropy of an isolated system always increases or remains constant in ideal cases but never decreases. This law defines the direction of natural processes, indicating that systems tend to move toward states with higher entropy.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Third Law of Thermodynamics:</strong> The Third Law states that as the temperature of a system approaches absolute zero (0 K), the entropy of the system approaches a minimum value. It implies that it is impossible to reach absolute zero temperature in a finite number of steps.
        </li>
      </ol>


      <h4>Other Fundamental Laws and Principles</h4>

      <ol>
        <li>
          <strong>Stefan-Boltzmann Law:</strong> The total radiant heat emitted from a surface is directly proportional to the fourth power of its absolute temperature.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Newton's Law of Cooling:</strong> The rate of heat loss of a body is directly proportional to the temperature difference between the body and its surroundings.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Newton's Law of Restitution:</strong> The velocities of colliding objects after collision depend on the materials they are made of.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Kirchhoff's Laws:</strong>
          <ul>
            <li><em>Current Law:</em> Total current entering a junction in a circuit equals the total current leaving.</li>
            <li><em>Voltage Law:</em> The algebraic sum of all voltages around a closed loop in a circuit is zero.</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
